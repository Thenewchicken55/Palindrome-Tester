# Palindrome

This is a C++ program that utlizes stack and queue data structures to verify the palindrome property.
A word is a palindrome if it spells the same backwards and forwards

### Example
> bob is palindrome
> bobe is not a palindrome
> racecar is a palindrome
> "A man, a plan, a canal, Panema!" is a palindrome if you ignore symbols, white space, and capitalization 

# Useage
